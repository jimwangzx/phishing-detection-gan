# Phishing Detection GAN

## About

The primary objective of this project is to effectively model phishing website characteristics using Generative Adversarial Networks, and use it to detect phishing attacks. We use only the visual and textual characteristics of the phishing website to model the attacker's signature. The primary use-case of this idea would primarily be for situations which require expedited re-training of the neural network, which would otherwise take a significantly longer time, when using large amounts website metadata for formulating the signature. The extended re-training time required is a significant attack vector which could be exploited by malicious agents.
